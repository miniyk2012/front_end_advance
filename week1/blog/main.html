                    <p class="concise-content">Media reports said Isshu Sugawara gave his Tokyo constituents expensive
                        melons, oranges, roe and royal jelly.

                        He is also said to have offered "condolence money" of 20,000 Japanese yen ($185; £145) to the
                        family of a supporter.

                        Japan's election law bans politicians from sending donations to voters in their home
                        constituency.

                        The allegations first surfaced in weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun, which said that Mr Sugawara's
                        secretary had offered about 20,000 yen to the family of a constituent who had passed away.

                    <p class="concise-content">The Norwegian blogger and TV personality - who describes herself as a
                        "very skinny, petite" woman - says she just "wanted a little lift" in that area of her body.

                        It wasn't hard to start researching the surgery.

                        Influencers all over her Instagram were promoting places and surgeons who could perform buttock
                        augmentation and BBL - Brazilian Butt Lift - procedures.

                        She found somewhere in Turkey that looked "very high end". And the price tag? Well she won't
                        reveal the exact figure but says it was a bargain.</p>

                        dramatically shrunk. Instead, it's a time of digging in, fighting your corner, staying the
                        course. No surrender.</p>
